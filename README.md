# MONAI Deploy App SDK

MONAI Deploy App SDK offers a framework and associated tools to design, develop and verify AI-driven applications in the healthcare imaging domain.

## Features

- Build medical imaging inference applications using a flexible, extensible & usable Pythonic API
- Easy management of inference applications via programmable Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
- Built-in operators to load DICOM data to be ingested in an inference app
- Out-of-the-box support for in-proc PyTorch based inference
- Easy incorporation of MONAI based pre and post transformations in the inference application
- Package inference application with a single command into a portable MONAI Application Package
- Locally run and debug your inference application using App Runner

## Installation

To install [the current release](https://pypi.org/project/monai-deploy-app-sdk/), you can simply run:

```bash
pip install monai-deploy-app-sdk  # '--pre' to install a pre-release version.
```

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install monai-deploy-app-sdk  # '--pre' to install a pre-release version.

# Clone monai-deploy-app-sdk repository for accessing examples.
git clone https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-app-sdk.git
cd monai-deploy-app-sdk

# Install necessary dependencies for simple_imaging_app
pip install scikit-image

# Execute the app locally
python examples/apps/simple_imaging_app/app.py -i examples/apps/simple_imaging_app/brain_mr_input.jpg -o output

# Package app (creating MAP docker image), using `-l DEBUG` option to see progress.
monai-deploy package examples/apps/simple_imaging_app -t simple_app:latest -l DEBUG

# Run the app with docker image and input file locally
monai-deploy run simple_app:latest examples/apps/simple_imaging_app/brain_mr_input.jpg output
```

[MedNIST demo](TBD) is available on Colab.
